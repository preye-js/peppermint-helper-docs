name: git-flow-ship
description: >
  Ships repo changes using this project's mandatory git-flow. Runs build, bases
  work on staging, uses feat/* branches only, rebases on origin/staging, and
  pushes the feature branch-never staging or main unless the user explicitly
  names that branch. Use when the user asks to push, ship, publish the branch,
  prepare for PR, run git-flow, follow git-flow before push, or invoke the
  git-flow-ship / ship agent.

# Git-flow ship (strict)

**Authoritative rule file (read it every time before acting):** `.cursor/rules/git-flow.mdc`

If anything here conflicts with `git-flow.mdc`, **`git-flow.mdc` wins.**

## Non-negotiables

- **`main`:** release only. **Do not push** unless the user **explicitly** says to push `main` (by name).
- **`staging`:** integration. **Do not push** unless the user **explicitly** says to push `staging` (by name).
- **Delivery** = **`feat/<short-description>`** pushed to `origin`, then the **user** opens **`feat/...` -> `staging`** PRs (and later `staging` -> `main`). The agent does **not** merge or open/close PRs unless the user explicitly asks.

## Workflow (execute in order)

0. **Always start from updated `staging`**
   - If current branch is **not** `staging`, immediately switch first:
     - `git checkout staging`
   - Then always sync it before continuing:
     - `git fetch origin`
     - `git pull origin staging`
   - Continue the rest of this workflow from that updated baseline.

1. **Inspect state**
   - `git status`, `git branch -vv`, confirm what is uncommitted and which branch you are on.
   - If there are unrelated changes mixed with the feature, stop and **split commits** or **stash** only with user direction-prefer separate logical commits (never one unrelated megacommit).

2. **Sync `staging`**
   - `git fetch origin`
   - `git checkout staging && git pull origin staging` (resolve any local-only mess first if needed).

3. **Feature branch**
   - If not already on `feat/...` for this work: `git checkout -b feat/<short-description>` from updated `staging`.
   - If already on a `feat/...` branch: merge or cherry-pick only as needed; **do not** deliver from `staging`/`main`.

4. **Commit**
   - Group changes into **focused commits** (one concern per commit). Do not mix unrelated files in the same commit.
   - Messages: clear, imperative, scoped (e.g. `feat(gallery): curated life preview`).

5. **Build gate (required before push)**
   - From repo root: **`npm run build`**
   - Fix failures before pushing. **`npm run lint`** if the project uses it and the change touches JS/TS/CSS.

6. **Rebase on integration branch**
   - `git fetch origin`
   - `git checkout feat/<short-description>`
   - `git rebase origin/staging`
   - Resolve conflicts on the feature branch; **never** force-push unless the user **explicitly** asks.

7. **Push (allowed target only)**
   - `git push -u origin feat/<short-description>`
   - **Do not** `git push origin staging` or `git push origin main` unless the user **explicitly** requested that exact branch.

8. **Report back**
   - Branch name pushed, commit summary (titles), and that the user should open **PR: `feat/...` -> `staging`** (and paste the GitHub "open PR" URL pattern if the remote is GitHub).

## Forbidden unless explicitly requested

- Pushing **`staging`** or **`main`**
- **`git push --force`** / **`--force-with-lease`** to shared branches
- Merging, squash-merge, closing issues, or managing PRs
- Deleting remotes or branches on the remote

## Quick reference

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout staging && git pull origin staging
git checkout -b feat/short-description   # or checkout existing feat branch
# ...commit in logical groups...
npm run build
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/staging
git push -u origin feat/short-description
```

## Project root

Assume repository root is the workspace containing `.cursor/rules/git-flow.mdc`. Adjust commands if the user's shell cwd differs.
